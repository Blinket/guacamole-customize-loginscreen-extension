# Guacamole Extension to Customize/Brand the Login Screen
This Apache Guacamole extension, in the form of a .jar file, is meant to act as a template for customizing or branding the login screen to utilize different colors, wording and logo. As is, it has a default placeholder logo, wording and colors. These can be updated within the .jar file without needing to buid the whole extension from scratch.

## Why use this extension vs x, y or z other options?
Other options may be perfectly valid. The benefit of using an extension (this one or another) to accomplish customizing the appearence of the login page in Apache Guacamole is that it should persist through updates/upgrades and can be easily re-implemented on additional Guacamole servers or in the event of needing to re-deploy an Apache Guacamole server with the same customized login screen. It is also easier to remove the customization if its no longer needed.
